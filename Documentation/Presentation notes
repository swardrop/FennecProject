Presentation notes (sorry for ugly formatting, ipad is bad for writing, but at least I figured out how to post now

Make sure you can hardware power down from software command
Make factory mode inaccessible to regular users (eg have a password)
Check max pin current and port current for LED shift register
If needed, you can use 1 pin for LED (not recommended though)
Use verbs in function names eg getSerial setValue etc


Put LED's as an output on hardware outputs
Have consistency between box and diagrams
Make the diagrams more clear
Put the hinge on long edge of box, not short edge
Probably better to just buy a box
Don't need 2 chip selects for LED's
17 buttons seems excessive
Be consistent with buttons (the g/oz is only button used on keypad, but is similar to on/off, tare buttons etc)
LCD instructions need an extra step to tell user to put more/less objects in to count after mass was calculated
Have a small delay/stabilisation time to make measurements more accurate in count mode
Use TTS for buttons like on/off instead of a beep
Possibly try use tones through TTS for simplicity
Make buttons in GUI similar to arrangement of hardware eg horizontal across the bottom instead of vertical
Don't have a button to go factory mode (make it secret)
Clarify the transition from factory mode to user local mode
Make the state diagram more accurate even though it will be messy as shit
Can we put it in sleep mode?
Group arrows together in state diagram that go in the same direction (eg set g and set oz)
Make clap extension more feasible or ditch it
Make the warning green as it is pretty much essential
DECIDE ON WHAT EXTENSIONS WE WILL DO AND DO THAT ONLY
Do a quick calibration early on and use that. Make it more accurate later on 
Redo gant chart?
Look at the scrum design technique
